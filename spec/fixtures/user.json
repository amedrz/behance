        "Where, When and What": "I spent my school years freelancing out of my father's architecture studio, so architecture and urbanism have had a huge influence on the way I approach design. From form to function.\n\nFollowing school in La Massana, I spent two years working for various small design shops in Barcelona like Zeligmedia, M.A.Y.A Design, and Triada Communication Agency. Eventually I felt that I needed to leave Barcelona to look for other opportunities, and I found myself heading to NYC in October 2002.\n\nI was lucky to be hired by Michael Ian Kaye (former Creative Director at Oglivy) to work at AR Media, where I had the chance to work on accounts such as Versace, Dolce & Gabanna, Valentino, Ann Taylor, Naturalizer, Influence Magazine, Escada, and many more.\n\nAfter that, I worked for Pro Am under the strict vigilance of John Malcolmson and Simon Endres, where I learned the craft of branding, and a love for design process.\n\nNow I find myself as Chief Designer at Behance, trying to make the lives of other creatives better."
